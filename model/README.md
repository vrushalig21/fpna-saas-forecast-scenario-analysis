This folder contains the core FP&A financial forecast model built for this project.

## Model Overview
- 24-month, monthly driver-based forecast
- Revenue modeled using customer growth, churn, and ARPU
- Operating expenses separated into fixed and variable components
- Scenario-based modeling (Base, Upside, Downside)

## Key Components
- Revenue build driven by customer acquisition and retention
- Cost of service modeled as a percentage of revenue
- Operating expenses modeled with growth and inflation assumptions
- EBITDA and EBITDA margin outputs

## Scenarios
The model includes three scenarios controlled via assumptions:
- Base Case: Expected growth and cost behavior
- Upside Case: Stronger customer acquisition and retention
- Downside Case: Slower growth and higher churn

## Outputs
- Monthly and annual revenue
- EBITDA and EBITDA margin
- Break-even analysis
- Scenario comparison tables

## Notes
